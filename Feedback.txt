# Overview

OpenDevStack allows to set up required infrastructure and continuous delivery
processes for new projects in less than 5 min.

OpenDevStack creates the required

- Confluence spaces,
- Jira projects,
- Bitbucket projects and repositories and
- OpenShift resources.

And all is tightly integrated. Simply provision a new project, commit and then
run your code.

## Confluence

Confluence is Atlassians' **content collaboration tool** used to help teams to
collaborate and share knowledge efficiently. With Confluence, your users can
create pages and blogs which can be commented on and edited by all members of
the team.

## Jira

Jira is Atlassians' **project- and issue-tracking platform**.

It combines issue tracking, agile project management, customizable workflow,
pluggable integration (e.g., GitHub, Asana and so on), and the kanban board to
increase the velocity.

## BitBucket

Bitbucket is Atlassians' **Git repository management** solution designed for
professional teams. It gives you a central place to manage git repositories,
collaborate on your source code and guide you through the development flow. It
provides awesome features that include:

- Acces control to restrict access to your source code.
- Workflow control to enforce a project or team workflow.
- Pull requests with in-line commenting for collaboration on code review.
- Jira integration for full development traceability.
- Full Rest API to build features custom to your workflow if they are not
  already available from our Marketplace

## Red Hat OpenShift

Red Hat OpenShift is the leading Kubernetes platform for delivering the
extraordinary to your users, faster than you can imagine.

# Getting started

## Requirements

- Git
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox
- Crowd
- Minishift
- Ansible
- Tailor

## Vagrant

Vagrant enables users to create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and
portable **development environments**. It leverages a *declarative configuration
file* which describes all your software requirements, packages, operating system
configuration, users, and more.

Cf. [Vagrant vs. Docker](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/vs/docker.html):
Vagrant is a tool focused on providing a consistent development environment
workflow across multiple operating systems. Docker is a container management
that can consistently run software as long as a containerization system exists.

The OpenDevStack uses Vagrant to *provide a sample infrastructure* for the
Atlassian tools, Rundeck and a so called Ansible controller, a VM, where you
can run Ansible scripts against the Atlassian VM.

## Crowd

[Atlassian's
Crowd](https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowd/introduction-to-crowd-152043763.html)
is a software application installed by the system administrator. The
administrator will also connect one or more of your organization's applications
to Crowd. When you log in to a Crowd-connected application, Crowd will verify
your password and login permissions.

Using Crowd for *single sign-on (SSO)*, each person needs only one username and
password to access all web applications. You can host your own OpenID provider
to include external applications.

## Minishift

[Minishift](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html) is
a tool provided by Red Hat to *run OpenShift locally* by providing a
single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM.
